## 🧠 About the Project

**SAVA** (Self-Aware Vector Agent) is a locally-operated artificial intelligence system  
designed to model human cognitive structures and achieve explainable, controllable, and self-directed AI.

This project was developed by **BADA Lab at Incheon National University**,  
with the aim of realizing the following key components for human-compatible AI:

- Memory-based reasoning and traceable inference
- Controllable architecture installable on local machines
- Triple-based memory structure using Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA)
- Metacognition, value alignment, and memory reconstruction

---

## 🧩 System Architecture (v1.0.0)

SAVA consists of three core components:

- **Cognitive Agent**: Processes user input, performs reasoning loops, and executes tool calls or self-calls for higher-level inference.  
- **Cognitive Buffer**: A short-term memory buffer built on SQLite, storing structured JSON records of user interactions.  
- **Inner Knowledge Base**: A long-term memory store implemented with TorchHD-based VSA, featuring hierarchical memory, forgetting, and reconstruction.

📘 For a full system overview, refer to the [`SAVA V1.0.0 Report`](./SAVA%20V1.0.0%20(20250718).pdf).

## 🧭 Use Cases

SAVA has been tested in the following applications:

- Personalized world model generation and memory-based question answering
- Solving advanced mathematics problems (AIME benchmark)  
- Automated short- to long-term memory transfer with priority-based layering  
- Value-aligned reasoning and metacognitive trace analysis

## 🤝 Collaborations & Future Plans

We welcome collaboration with institutions and organizations such as:

- Ethics and cognitive science education: KAIST, SNU, Korean Association for AI Ethics  
- Real-world deployment of local AI assistants: Samsung Electronics, NHN Cloud, Naver Clova  
- Government-funded R&D: Digital Platform Government, AI-on-Chip Edge AI Projects

Upcoming features in version **v2.0.0** will include self-agent chaining, LLM injection, and peer-to-peer memory sharing.
